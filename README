AnimeGrep: grep your favorite one-liner in anime as (a) clip(s)!
--------------


animegrep is a bash script that extracts the subtitles from an mkv video file (main use for me is anime), 
greps them for a specified word, parses them and extracts only that time frame from the source video file. 
The script outputs the clips created to out/clips.


USAGE
--------------

-f <file>  the file you want to extract clips from

-d <directory>  the directory you want to extract clips from (it does all the MKVs in the directory)

-w <word>   the phrase you are grepping for

-m   merge all files in one file.
